**two_sum(self, nums: list, target: int)

    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
    Example:
        Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
        Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
        return [0, 1].
    
    Output:
        -  list of integers (indices of two numbers from the given list sum of which equal to target number)
