**01**

    You have a basketball hoop and someine says you can play one of two games.
    Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
    Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of treee shots.
    If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?


**02**

    There are three ants on different vertices of triangle.
    What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the side of the triangle?
    Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, which either direction being equaly likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.
    Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.


**03**

    Given two lines on a Cartesian plane, determine whether the two lines would intersect.


**04 add_operator_only.py**

    Wright methods to implement the multiply, subtract and divide operations for integers. Use only the add operator.


**05 cut_squares_in_half.py**
    
    Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a best_line that would cut these two squares in half.
    Assume that the top and the bottom of the square run parallel to the x-axis.  


**06 pass_most_points.py**

    Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a best_line which passes the most number of points.


**07 kth_number_with_prime_factors.py**

    Design algorithm to find the kth number such that the only prime factors are 3, 5, 7.
