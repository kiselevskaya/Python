    Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

02_list_as_stacks_flexible.py

    Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

    This approach allow the stack blocks to be flexible in size.
    When one stack exceeds its initial capacity, we grow the allowable capacity and shift elements as necessary.
    Also design array to be circular, such that the final stack may start at the end of the array and wrap to the beginning.
