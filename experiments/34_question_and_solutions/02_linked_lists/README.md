**Linked Lists**


**01_remove_duplicates.py**

    Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
    How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed.


**02_kth_to_last_node.py**

    Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of singly linked list.


**03_delete_node.py**

    Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of singly linked list, given only access to that node.

    Example:
    Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->f
    Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like  a->b->d->f
