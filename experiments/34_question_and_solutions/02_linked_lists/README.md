**Linked Lists**


**linked_list.py**

    Contains class LinkedList with append, length and output methods and class Node to make a single linked list node.


**01_remove_duplicates.py**

    Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
    How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed.


**02_kth_to_last_node.py**

    Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of singly linked list.


**03_delete_node.py**

    Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of singly linked list, given only access to that node.

    Example:
    Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->f
    Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like  a->b->d->f


**04_partition_list.py**

    Write the code to partition a linked list around a value x,
    such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.


**05_sum_numbers.py**

    You have two numbers represented by a listed list, where each node contains a single digit.
    The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1'st digit is at the head of the list.
    Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
    EXAMPLE
    Input:(7->1->6) + (5->9->2). That is, 617+295.
    Output: 2->1->9. That is, 912

    Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
    EXAMPLE
    Input:(6->1->7) + (2->9->5). That is, 617+295.
    Output: 9->1->2. That is, 912


**06_start_loop_node.py**

    Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns the node at the beginning of the loop.
    DEFINITION
    Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
    EXAMPLE
    Input: A->B->C->D->E->C->[the same as earlier]
    Output: C


**07_palindrome.py**

    Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
