Counting sort

Create a <new_list> with <n> zeros, depend on <max_number> in the <sorting_list>.
Consistently read <elements> from the <sorting_list> and for every <element> in the <sorting_list> enlarge <new_list[<sorting_list>[<element>]]> by one.
Go through the <new_list> and for every <number> from zero to max number in the <sorting_list> consistently write to <sorting_list> <number> <new_list[number]> time.
